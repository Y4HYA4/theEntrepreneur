In the context of Microsoft Windows and administration, a "domain" refers to a group of computers and devices that are connected to a central directory for authentication and authorization. Users and devices within a domain can access resources and services on the network using a single set of credentials, and administrators can centrally manage and secure these resources. A domain also allows for the use of group policies, which can be used to enforce security and configuration settings across multiple computers and devices.
